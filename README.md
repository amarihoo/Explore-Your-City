### **About the Project**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that the short term traveler to any given major city will explore as much as possible during their stay, and tons of resources exist to guide them to landmarks, restaurants, and local events.  However, the long term, or even lifetime, resident is often neglected, as it is assumed that a local knows all the ins and outs of their respective city. This project aims to provide long term residents local-specific resources to motivate and facilitate continual exploration of their city.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project focuses on an interactive tracking application that will provide consolidated, up-to-date information about events, trending local favorites, and new/changing business locations, as well as simply connect users to places/information they might not have been aware of previously.  Users will be able to view and track their exploration of new parts of their city; the goal being to explore as many new places as possible.  By providing current and locally-geared information in a consolidated format, long term residents will be able to easily and comfortably explore the city they call home.
